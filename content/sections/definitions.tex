processes now known or later developed.

including, without limitation, any translation, musical arrangement, 
dramatization, fictionalization, motion-picture or audiovisual version, sound 
recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in

Non-Commercial Use includes private use (e.g. offline storage, private display), 
scientific research without selling the research paper, educational classroom

private sphere.
